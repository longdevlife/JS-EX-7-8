# Array Exercises

This project is designed to help users practice and implement various operations on arrays using JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting integers and real numbers, and it performs a series of calculations based on the user's input.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the web page, containing input fields, buttons, and sections for displaying results.
- `css/style.css`: Styles for the web page, defining layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance.
- `js/main.js`: JavaScript code implementing the required functionalities.

## Functionalities

The project includes the following functionalities:

1. **Sum of Positive Numbers**: Calculates the total of all positive integers in the array.
2. **Count of Positive Numbers**: Counts how many positive integers are present in the array.
3. **Smallest Number**: Finds the smallest number in the array.
4. **Smallest Positive Number**: Identifies the smallest positive number in the array.
5. **Last Even Number**: Searches for the last even number in the array, returning -1 if none exists.
6. **Swap Values**: Allows users to swap two values in the array based on specified positions.
7. **Sort Array**: Sorts the array in ascending order.
8. **First Prime Number**: Finds the first prime number in the array, returning -1 if none exists.
9. **Count Integers in Real Numbers**: Accepts an additional array of real numbers and counts how many integers are present.
10. **Compare Positive and Negative Counts**: Compares the count of positive and negative numbers to determine which is greater.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the input fields to enter integers and real numbers.
4. Click the corresponding buttons to perform the desired operations.
5. View the results displayed on the web page.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the functionalities to work.
- The project is designed for educational purposes to enhance understanding of arrays and JavaScript programming.
